\textit{The below learning plan is not set in stone. Be open for modifications and new ideas. Follow your curiosity.}
\subsection*{\sout{Calculus of Variations in Physics}}   
\begin{itemize}
    \item \sout{Understand the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange Equations}
    \item \sout{Solve the QM problem in Hand and Finch (17th December)}
    \item \sout{Answer questions below and synthesize and finalize notes on the topic (20th December)}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\sout{Questions}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \sout{How is it used in modern physics today?}
    \item \sout{Does one use different "actions" when working on separate problems. If so, could one find a problem "midway" between those problems and see what the action looks like there? Maybe smoothly interpolate an action between these two problems to gain a deeper understanding of how and why they need different descriptions. Maybe find a general description which they are both special cases of.}
