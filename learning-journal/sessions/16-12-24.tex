\section{Session Date: 16th December, 2024}
\subsection*{Main Topic: Electromagnetism}
\subsection*{Topics Covered}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total momentum in fields from momentum density
    \item Angular momentum in the fields from momentum density
    \item Complex current from complex impedances
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Insights}
\subsubsection*{Takeaways}
If one has a field whose magnitude only depends on \(r\) but whose direction is given by \(\hat{\mathbf{\phi}}\), then any integral one full revolution in the \(\phi \)-direction will of course give \(\mathbf{0}\). This makes great sense both when you think about it geometrically (you will add up as many components in one direction as in any other, hence summing up to zero) or if you write it out in cartesian components you will integrate \(\sin \phi \) and \(\cos \phi \) around a full period which gives zero.

\subsection*{Follow-Up Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does one derive rest energy? I don't remember where it comes from.
    \textbf{Answer:} It comes from \(E^{2} = (pc)^{2} + (m c^{2} )^{2} \). Where this is derived from will have to wait.
\end{itemize}
